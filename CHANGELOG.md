## [Unreleased]

### UI
- Polished Intention edit/create UI (record CTA + card styling).
- Home UI polish (progress menu): Top bar title only; hamburger moved to Today's Progress card; arrow navigates to Momentum tab.
- Mood ? label: updated typography (rounded font, teal accent); mood state resets per day (stored by dateKey).
- Weekly momentum alignment: day labels aligned, bars bottom-aligned, slightly larger bars and text.
- Fixed streak counter (no longer always 0): now based on consecutive days with at least one check-in.
